# mrpt_ros_bridge
C++ library and apps for bidirectional interface MRPT &lt;-> ROS{1,2}

This repository holds everything related to `ROS<->MRPT` after MRPT 3.0.0 is released,
which will be totally independent of ROS. In this way, ROS-related changes can be 
released often via this repository without affecting upstream MRPT.
